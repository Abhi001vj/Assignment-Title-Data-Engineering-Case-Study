An assessment on how to handle programmatic advertising and manages multiple online advertising campaigns 
# Assignment Title: Data Engineering Case Study

Imagine you are a data engineer working for AdvertiseX, a digital advertising technology company. AdvertiseX specializes in programmatic advertising and manages multiple online advertising campaigns for its clients. The company handles vast amounts of data generated by ad impressions, clicks, conversions, and more. Your role as a data engineer is to address the following challenges:

# Data Sources and Formats:

## Ad Impressions:

Data Source: AdvertiseX serves digital ads to various online platforms and websites.
Data Format: Ad impressions data is generated in JSON format, containing information such as ad creative ID, user ID, timestamp, and the website where the ad was displayed.

## Clicks and Conversions:

Data Source: AdvertiseX tracks user interactions with ads, including clicks and conversions (e.g., sign-ups, purchases).
Data Format: Click and conversion data is logged in CSV format and includes event timestamps, user IDs, ad campaign IDs, and conversion type.
## Bid Requests:

### Data Source: AdvertiseX participates in real-time bidding (RTB) auctions to serve ads to users.
### Data Format: Bid request data is received in a semi-structured format, mostly in Avro, and includes user information, auction details, and ad targeting criteria.

## Case Study Solution
Detailed Data Engineering Solution for AdvertiseX
### Overview
This solution is designed to efficiently process and analyze ad impressions, clicks/conversions, and bid requests data to optimize AdvertiseX's programmatic advertising campaigns. The system handles JSON, CSV, and Avro data formats, ensuring high throughput, data integrity, and actionable insights for campaign performance.

1. Data Ingestion
**Objective**
Build a robust data ingestion system capable of handling real-time and batch data in various formats.

**Technologies**
- Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion
- Apache NiFi or Apache Flume for data routing and preprocessing
- Apache Avro for handling schema-based binary data formats

                            +----------------------+
```
#### Implementation Steps
**Setup Apache Kafka:**

- Deploy Kafka brokers.
- Create topics for ad impressions, clicks/conversions, and bid requests.
**Configure Apache NiFi:**

- Create data flow processors for each data source type.
- Transform and route data to the appropriate Kafka topics.

Key Considerations:
Schema Management: Implement schema registry for Avro data to manage versioning and compatibility.
Data Normalization: Preprocess data to normalize varying formats and structures, ensuring consistency before ingestion into the processing system.
Error Handling: Establish robust error handling mechanisms for malformed data, including retries, logging, and dead-letter queues.
2. Data Processing
**Objective**
- Standardize, validate, and enrich incoming data.
- Correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions.
**Technologies**
- Apache Spark

```
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("AdDataProcessing").getOrCreate()

# Read from Kafka
impressions_df = spark \
  .readStream \
  .format("kafka") \
  .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092") \
  .option("subscribe", "ad-impressions-topic") \
  .load()

# Data Transformation (Example: Filtering Invalid Impressions)
valid_impressions_df = impressions_df.filter(col("user_id").isNotNull())

# Write to Data Lake/Warehouse
valid_impressions_df.writeStream \
  .format("parquet") \
  .option("checkpointLocation", "/path/to/checkpoint") \
  .option("path", "/path/to/data/lake") \
  .start()
```

#### Feature Extraction
User Engagement Features: Extract metrics such as click-through rate (CTR), time spent on the ad, and interaction depth.
Ad Performance Features: Calculate ad impressions, clicks, conversion rates, and cost per acquisition (CPA).
Contextual Features: Include data about the user's device, location, time of day, and the content surrounding the ad impression.
**Common Metrics and KPIs**
- Click-Through Rate (CTR): The ratio of users who click on an ad to the number of total users who view the ad (impressions).
- Conversion Rate: The percentage of clicks that resulted in a conversion action (e.g., purchase, sign-up).
- Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS): The amount of revenue generated for every dollar spent on advertising.
- Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM): Key cost metrics for campaign performance evaluation.
**Data Enrichment**
- Temporal Enrichment: Add features related to time, such as part of the day, weekday vs. weekend, and seasonality.
- Geographical Enrichment: Enhance data with geographical insights, such as region-specific performance and user demographics.
- Behavioral Segmentation: Classify users based on their interaction patterns and history to tailor future ad delivery.
#### Visualization and Reporting
**Objective:** Leverage data visualization and reporting tools to create actionable insights and intuitive dashboards for campaign performance monitoring.

**Visualization Techniques**
- Time Series Analysis: Visualize trends over time for key metrics like CTR, CPC, and conversion rates.
- Geographical Heatmaps: Display performance metrics across different regions to identify high and low-performing areas.
- Funnel Analysis: Create funnels to visualize the conversion path from impressions to clicks to conversions, identifying drop-off points.

#### Dashboard and Reporting Tools
- Apache Superset or Grafana for real-time analytics dashboards.
- Tableau or Power BI for in-depth analysis and interactive reporting.
- Integration with Apache Airflow for automated reporting workflows and alerts based on performance thresholds.
KPIs and Alerts
- Set up real-time alerts for significant changes in KPIs (e.g., sudden drops in CTR or spikes in CPC), allowing quick response to potential issues.
- Customizable dashboard widgets to track the performance of specific campaigns, ad groups, or creatives against their targets.

3. Data Storage and Query Performance
**Objective**
- Efficiently store processed data, enabling fast and flexible querying for analytics.
- Utilize a real-time NoSQL database for immediate data access and analysis.
**Technologies**
- Amazon Redshift
- Apache Hadoop HDFS + Hive
- Real-time NoSQL database (e.g., Apache Cassandra, MongoDB)
